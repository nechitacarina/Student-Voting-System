This is my final year project, a web application called "Voting System for Students". 
This project allows different types of users to perform different actions which are related to their role. 
So, the system admins can manage the voting admins and the voting admins can manage the voters and the voting polls. 
Also, through this application the students can express their vote in an easy way.
I developed this project using Spring Boot, Hibernate, Thymeleaf and MySQL database.
